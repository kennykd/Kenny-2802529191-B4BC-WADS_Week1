# Git and GitHub in Web Application Development

## GitHub and Collaboration
GitHub extends Git by providing:
- Remote repositories for backup and sharing
- Pull requests for structured code review
- Issue tracking for bugs and feature requests
- CI/CD integration for automated testing and deployment

In team-based web development, GitHub helps enforce good security practices by enabling peer reviews and limiting direct access to production branches.
