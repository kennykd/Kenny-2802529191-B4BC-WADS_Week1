# Git and GitHub in Web Application Development

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code over time. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and enables collaboration, code review, and project management. Together, Git and GitHub form the backbone of modern web application development workflows.

## Why Git Is Important in Web Development
Web applications evolve rapidly. Features are added, bugs are fixed, and security issues are patched regularly. Git allows developers to:
- Track every change made to the codebase
- Revert to previous versions when errors occur
- Work on multiple features simultaneously using branches
- Collaborate safely without overwriting each other’s work

## GitHub and Collaboration
GitHub extends Git by providing:
- Remote repositories for backup and sharing
- Pull requests for structured code review
- Issue tracking for bugs and feature requests
- CI/CD integration for automated testing and deployment

In team-based web development, GitHub helps enforce good security practices by enabling peer reviews and limiting direct access to production branches.

## Security Considerations
GitHub also plays a role in web security:
- Sensitive data should never be committed (e.g., API keys)
- `.env` files should be excluded using `.gitignore`
- Branch protection rules prevent unsafe code from being merged
- Commit history provides accountability and audit trails

## Conclusion
Git and GitHub are essential tools for building secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Mastering them early is critical for any web developer.
